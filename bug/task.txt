Task: 
    Page is loading and it is showing the right final text "Landing Page 3", but there are errors 
    in the console.log. Please fix the app to continue working, but fixing the bugs.

Console.log should keep showing "Landing Page 1" when the page first loads, and then it should keep displaying all of the state.text updates (e.g. Landing Page 2 and Landing Page 3)
