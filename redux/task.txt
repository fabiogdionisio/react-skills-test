Task: 
    App component is currently holding a local state "text" and passing down its value to its children. 
    We want to use redux to centralize the state info and read from the redux store to display the value inside the ChildComponent.
    App should write to redux store and ChildComponent should read from it.
    Initial state for the redux store "text" should be "initial state text", then App will override this value with "App changed it".
